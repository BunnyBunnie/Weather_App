# üå¶Ô∏è Weather App Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for a user-friendly weather application. The app will provide official weather data and allow users to submit their own reports, creating a community-driven source of information. We'll be using an **Agile development** approach to ensure we can adapt and improve as we go.

## üìù Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Week 1)

**Objective:** Define the project's scope, core features, and target audience.

### Project Vision

* **Goal:** Create a simple and intuitive weather app that combines official data with crowdsourced reports. The target completion date is **November 2025**.
* **Target Audience:** Anyone who needs quick weather updates, as well as community members who want to share local weather conditions.

### Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

* **Weather Display:**
    * Show current temperature, conditions (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy"), humidity, and wind speed.
    * Display a 5-day weather forecast.
    * Integrate a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
* **Location Search:**
    * Allow users to search for weather in different cities.
* **User-Submitted Weather:**
    * A simple form for users to submit the current temperature and conditions.
    * A way to view user-submitted reports for a specific area.

### Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Kivy (using Python for a cross-platform mobile and desktop application).
* **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Firestore for the database, Firebase Hosting for deployment).
* **Weather Data:** A free weather API key.

### High-Level Timeline

* **Week 1:** Planning & Design
* **Weeks 2-3:** Development
* **Week 4:** Testing & Deployment
* **Ongoing:** Maintenance & Future Feature Iteration

## üé® Phase 2: Design (Concurrent with Week 1)

**Objective:** Create the app's architecture and visual design.

### System Architecture

* **Client-Side (Frontend):** A Kivy application that fetches data from the weather API and our Firestore database.
* **Server-Side (Backend):** Firebase will handle user data storage. A `weather_reports` collection in Firestore will store user submissions.

### Data Flow

1.  The app loads and gets the user's location.
2.  It calls the weather API for official data.
3.  It queries Firestore for recent user-submitted reports in that area.
4.  Both sets of data are displayed to the user.
5.  The user submits a new report, which is written to the Firestore database.

### Database Schema (Firestore)

* **Collection:** `user_reports`
* **Document:** (auto-generated ID)
    * `city`: string
    * `latitude`: number
    * `longitude`: number
    * `reported_temp`: number
    * `reported_condition`: string (e.g., "Rain", "Fog")
    * `timestamp`: timestamp

### UI/UX Wireframing

* **Main View:** A clean interface showing the current weather prominently, with a clearly visible "Report Inaccuracy" button.
* **Forecast View:** A simple list or series of cards for the next 5 days.
* **Submission Form:** A modal or separate page with fields for temperature and a dropdown for weather conditions.

## üíª Phase 3: Development (Weeks 2-3)

**Objective:** Write the code for the application.

### Sprint 1 (Week 2): Core Weather Functionality

* Set up the Kivy project.
* Integrate the weather API to fetch and display current weather and the forecast.
* Implement the location search functionality.
* Build the main UI components using Kivy widgets.

### Sprint 2 (Week 3): User Submission Feature

* Set up the Firebase project and configure Firestore.
* Create the weather submission form using Kivy.
* Write the logic to save user reports to the Firestore database.
* Develop the functionality to fetch and display user-submitted reports.

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing (Week 4)

**Objective:** Ensure the app is bug-free and meets user expectations.

* **Unit Testing:** Test individual functions, such as the API data fetching logic.
* **Integration Testing:** Verify that the frontend correctly communicates with the weather API and Firebase.
* **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback from potential users on the app's ease of use.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensure the app works correctly on major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## üöÄ Phase 5: Deployment (End of Week 4)

**Objective:** Launch the application.

* **Build for Production:** Package the Kivy executable.
* **Deploy to Hosting:** Deploy the application using Firebase Hosting.
* **Final Checks:** Ensure the live API keys are correctly configured and the database security rules are in place.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 6: Maintenance & Iteration (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Monitor the app's performance, fix bugs, and plan for future features.

* **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on API usage and database activity.
* **Bug Fixes:** Address any issues reported by users.
* **Future Feature Backlog:**
    * User accounts to track submissions.
    * A map view to visualize user reports.
    * Push notifications for weather alerts.
    * A system to "upvote" accurate user reports.
